# ServPro
Local Service Provider ChatBot
In today’s fast-paced world, finding reliable local services such as plumbers, electricians, and cleaners is a significant challenge. Traditional GPS-based services only provide proximity-based recommendations without considering user experience or service quality. This gap presents an opportunity to create a more personalized and effective solution, which is where ServPro comes into play.

ServPro is a conversational AI chatbot designed to help users effortlessly connect with local service providers. Unlike conventional solutions, ServPro leverages cutting-edge technologies such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), geolocation services, and user reviews to provide recommendations that are not only based on proximity but also user feedback and service quality. This user-centered approach eliminates the need for time-consuming searches, ensuring that users can quickly find and book trusted local services within a few simple steps.

ServPro goes beyond just providing a list of nearby service providers. By integrating features such as user ratings, reviews, and appointment scheduling within the chatbot, it allows users to make informed decisions and book services without switching between multiple applications. With its intelligent matching system, ServPro aims to revolutionize how users connect with local service providers, offering a seamless and efficient experience.

In this project, we explore the development of this chatbot, its core features, and its technical architecture. ServPro’s goal is to create an efficient, scalable, and highly personalized platform for on-demand local services.
